# A Bottom-Up Approach to Mutual Fund Marketing by Analyzing Trending Topics
This is the final project for the course <a href="http://coursemap.aca.ntu.edu.tw/course_map_all/course.php?code=723+M9900" target="_blank">Fin7067: Fintech-Text Mining and Machine Learning</a> at National Taiwan University. Our group collaborated with <a href="https://www.nomurafunds.com.tw/Web/Content/#/index" target="_blank">Nomura Asset Management</a> to explore ways to reduce investor search cost and improve marketing ROI.  

## Introduction
The current practice of the mutual fund industry follows the traditional Top-Down marketing process—starting by determining the product to promote, identifying the target audience, deciding on the marketing channel, and finally distributing marketing materials. As Roussanov et al. (2020) showed in their research, funds could make a profit by targeting less sophisticated investors in an environment with higher search friction. However,  when the search cost becomes sufficiently low the aforementioned strategy would no longer be profitable. With the emergence of internet and better investor education comes declining search cost, and active fund managers 
are seeing the effect unfold through outflows towards lower cost passive index funds. Therefore, the goal of our project is to present a Bottom-Up approach by analyzing trending topics among investor to help fund managers make more informed decisions with the allocation of their marketing budget.

## Design Process
Our data contains content from online investing forums (<a href="https://forum.fundhot.com/" target="_blank">Fundhot</a>, <a href="https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Fund/index.html" target="_blank">PTT Fund</a>), financial media outlets (<a href="https://www.businesstoday.com.tw/" target="_blank">Business Today</a>, <a href="https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/" target="_blank">Business Weekly</a>, <a href="https://www.cnyes.com/" target="_blank">Anue</a>, <a href="https://www.gvm.com.tw/" target="_blank">Global Views Magazine</a>), and industry peer (<a href="https://tw.allianzgi.com/zh-tw" target="_blank">Allianz Global Investors</a>). The scrapped data was parsed with Beautiful Soup, and segmented using Jieba. We chose Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as the topic modeling method and pyLDAvis to visualize the fitted LDA topic model to help us interpret the topics.
Finally, the topics obtained from the model are presented as an interactive stacked bar chart. It could be used in conjunction with the keywords associated with each topic to give the marketing team a better understanding of the market trends.
